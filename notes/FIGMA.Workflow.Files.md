##### **Suggestion:** 2-3 Copies per File
- ##### Copy A: "Main" / "Presentation" / "Final"
  - **Name Format:** "Name"
  - **Light-weight** - few assets
  - **Clean** - little or no unnecessary clutter or notes
  - **Clear** - labeling, instructions, etc.

- ##### Copy B: "WIP (Work in Progress)" / "Research" / "Development"
  - **Name Format:** "Name-WIP" | "Name-DETAIL"
  - **Heavy-weight** (Image options, experimental versions, etc.)
  - **Annotated** (Heavy annotation.)
  - **Detailed** (Additional labeling, instructions, and notes.)

- ##### OPTIONAL Copy C: "Discovery" / "Experiments" / "Brainstorming" / "Initial"
  - **Name Format:** "Name-RESEARCH"
  - **Xtra-Heavy** - of course
  - **Primary Use** - the file to play around with


##### **Suggestion:** Page Structure
*   **Visual research**: A home for all those wonderful Dribbble screenshots we like to use as inspiration
*   **User research**: A space for user testing flows and concepts
*   **Discovery**: This is where we put all of our (amazing!) rejected or rough ideas
*   **Flow**: This is where we can start to pull together our formalized ideas into a structured canvas for feedback
*   **Ready for development**: Once sign-off by the key stakeholders has been done, we organize our work in this page. Don’t even think about editing this page once the URL has been shared with your developers
    *   **Pro tip:** If you find yourself working on a file that has already passed sign-off (we’ve all been there), use the [Status Annotations plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/795096273369409539/Status-Annotations) to signify your progress on individual pieces of work.

- **Spacer Pages:** If you want to go to the next level, you can even include spacer pages in your side panel so that there is more distinction between phases.
