#### Commonalities of both Groups & Frames
- They are illustrated and can be manipulated in the Layers left-side sidebar.
- That's it, but can be the source of confusion for some.

#### Groups
- Simply a grouping of their objects.
- A group's dimensions are completely dependent upon the placement of the objects within them.
- Groups have no properties of their own.
- Three-fold purpose:
  - 1) To manipulate layering (which objects sit on top or below other objects.)
  - 2) To move & resize components of the same group as one unit.
  - 3) To ajdust properties of objects in bulk.
- A `MouseClick` on any grouped object select the group itself.
- Use `Cmd + MouseClick` to select a specific object.

#### Frames
- Frames can have their own:
  - Dimensions
  - Properties
- Some of of the Frame properties can affect the objects within them.


#### Tips and Tricks
- You can convert a Group into a Frame and a Frame into a Group by clicking on the Frame/Group dropdown just above the sidebar dimensions.
